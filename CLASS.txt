Class :
 * Class is a blueprint of an object
 * Class is a set of data and code
 * If we define a class then we create so many number of objects which belong to that class
 * Object are nothing but variables of the type class 
 * Example :
	class A
	{
		public static void main(String[] args)
		{
			System.out.println("class A");
		}
	}
